# Simple Search
**Applies to**: Repository API v1.
<br/>
<sup>[See Repository API v2](../guide_simple-search-v2/).</sup>

The simple search API can run a search query in the repository and return the results of the search immediately in the response of the call. [See the following topic to view the differences between simple search and search](../guide_search-vs-simple-search/).

In the following simple search, we want to find entries with a specific value in the _Purchase Order ID_ field.

```xml
POST https://api.laserfiche.com/repository/v1/Repositories/repoId/SimpleSearches
{
"searchCommand":"{[]:[Purchase Order ID]=\"789\"}"
}
```

The response will include a listing of the entries that matched the search query. See the following sample response for the above search:

```xml
HTTP 200 Ok
{
  "value":[
    {
      "id":1234,
      "name":"PurchaseOrder",
      "parentId":1,
      "fullPath":"",
      "folderPath":"",
      "creator":"Guide User",
      "creationTime":"2020-12-12T12:00:00-00:00",
      "lastModifiedTime":"2020-12-12T12:00:00-00:00,
      "entryType":"Document",
      "templateName":null,
      "templateId":0,
      "templateFieldNames":[],
      "volumeName":"DEFAULTVOLUME"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Additional Information

Simple searches are limited to a maximum of **100** results. An HTTP _206 Partial Content_ status code indicates that the search results are truncated. A non-truncated search response will return an HTTP 200.

Simple searches will automatically time out if the search operation exceeds **15** seconds.

A single session can only have two searches running at one time. This limit does not differentiate between search and simple search.
